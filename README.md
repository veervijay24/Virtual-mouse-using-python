# Virtual-mouse-using-python
A virtual mouse is a software-based mouse that can be controlled using keyboard or other input devices. In Python, you can create a virtual mouse using the pyautogui library, which provides functions to control the mouse and keyboard. In this code, we first import the pyautogui library and initialize the initial position of the mouse.
